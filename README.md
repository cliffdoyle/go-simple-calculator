# Go-Simple-Calculator

This is a simple command-line calculator program written in Go that performs basic arithmetic operations on two integer values. It supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulo operations.

## Features

- Supports addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and modulo (%) operations.
- Handles negative numbers and division by zero cases.
- Provides a straightforward interface for performing arithmetic calculations via the command line.
- Easily extendable for future enhancements or additional operations.

## Usage

To use this calculator, run the executable with three command-line arguments:


- `value1`: The first integer operand.
- `operator`: The arithmetic operator to apply (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`).
- `value2`: The second integer operand.

Example:

go run . 10 + 5

This will output the result of the arithmetic operation, in this case, `15`.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the `calculator.go` file using the Go compiler.

3. Run the compiled executable with appropriate command-line arguments to perform arithmetic calculations.
